All major or breaking changes will be documented in this file, as well as any new features that should be highlighted. Minor fixes or improvements are not necessarily listed.

## Sep. 13 2022 (Freeman)
- Create repo and initiate the project.
- Add `Log.py`, `ThreadRunnable.py`, and `utils.py` to libs dir. 
These files contains some handy functions I used from previous project (COMP9331).
- Add `.gitignore`. This file contains commonly unwanted files and dirs. Welcome to add more if needed.
- Add `requirements.txt`. For reference only. Will be changed in the future. 
The code will eventually run on the Jetson nano. 
We should follow the libraries or versions that can work on Jetson nano.
